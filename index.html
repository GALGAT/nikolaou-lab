        <h3>About the Nikolaou's Research Group</h3>
        <p>Our research aims at the development of fundamental methods for the intelligent design and operation of engineered systems, translating theoretical frameworks into solutions for real-world problems. Whether dealing with a chemical plant, hydrocarbon production, or a medicated human patient, intelligent design offers distinct advantages in safety, quality, reliability, and performance.</p>

        <p>We employ quantitative analysis tools—including mathematical modeling, optimization, statistics, and feedback control—to build the "brains" of these systems. With a strong interdisciplinary flavor, our work relies on collaboration with domain experts and field practitioners to test solutions via computer simulations, laboratory experiments, and full-scale implementations.</p>
